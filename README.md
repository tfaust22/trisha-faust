I'm currently taking INFO 591 and INFO 662, so I'm learning about metadata, curation, and stewardship this quarter.
I've used GitHub before for INFO 552 to assist with building and creating websites.
You can reach me at tf535@drexel.edu.
My pronouns are she/her.
I currently work at Kutztown University.
I just traveled to Washington, D.C. and toured the Library of Congress with friends.
